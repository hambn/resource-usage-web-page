## Installation and Usage

Follow these simple steps to get started:

### Clone the Repository and Navigate to the Directory
Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hambn/resource-usage-web-page.git ./resource-usage-web-page && cd ./resource-usage-web-page
```

### Run the Scripts
You can run either the Python or the Bash script, depending on your preference.

**To run the Python script:**
```bash
python3 script.py
```
**To run the Bash script:**
```bash
./script.sh
```
If you encounter a permission error, make sure to give the script execution permission:
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```
### Viewing the Application
Once the script is running, the application should be visible in your browser at:
```
http://<your-ip>:5000
```
### Notes
- **Platform Compatibility:** Both scripts are designed to work on Unix-like systems. Ensure you have the required interpreters installed (Python 3 for `script.py` and Bash for `script.sh`).
- **Dependencies:** No additional packages are required; both scripts utilize built-in commands and modules.
